- Hi, I’m @sararimuro AKA Max! ^^
- I’m interested in all things ICT, namely programming, problem solving, information security and game design.
- Endlessly fascinated by technology: from the way we buy things and choose a movie for the evening to the way social media algorithms influence global way of thought, next election results and future climate policies.
- I am a self-taught Pythonista with a good level of understanding of basic operators, functions, objects and the concenpts adjacent to them.
- Currently studying information and comminucation technologies at Stadin ammattiopisto.
- Through my degree studies I familiarized myself with such technologies as C, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL.
- I have basic understanding of data structures and algorithms and code optimization to an extent, and looking to learn more about the concepts through practical experience.
- I’m looking for my first job in the ICT industry and opportunities to deepen my expertise in programming.
- I am using GitHub to host my practice projects and the schoolwork, as a little demonstration of the things I've learnt.
- Always grateful for tips, new challenges and opportunities to learn!
- Based in Helsinki Metropolitan Region, Finland
- You can reach me by email at sararimuro@gmail.com!
